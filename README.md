# Game-Theory-CW1
Code for game theory coursework Nov 2023
The code for section [3.2](https://github.com/leorjones/Game-Theory-CW1/blob/main/payofftab_dom.py)
The first half of this file is for generating the payoff tables (with variance of the payoff matricies and number of rounds) and the second half is checking for dominance.
The nxn tables up to n=5 (they get very big after this) are in the text files.

The code for section [4](https://github.com/leorjones/Game-Theory-CW1/blob/main/finitecheat.py) and [extended](https://github.com/leorjones/Game-Theory-CW1/blob/main/infinitepickup.py)
